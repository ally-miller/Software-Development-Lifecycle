Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves understanding the requirements and expectations of end users and translating them into actionable developmental tasks. User stories are a way to do this. User stories break down large problems into smaller manageable stories that can be developed easier in a short sprint. 

Approaching the development of a program with an agile mindset involves embracing practices that prioritize adaptability, collaboration, and small increments or sprints. There are many aspects of agile I will work to incorporate into my future developmental work, like breaking down projects into smaller, manageable tasks. I will also try to do my own sprints, so I work on future projects a bit at a time instead of all in one sitting. And with any group work I will make sure to collaborate with my team and try to foster a positive working experience, so we all are motivated on the project. 

Being a good team member in software development is more than just having technical expertise. Having effective communication skills is paramount as well as having a desire to do better. Also being willing to adapt to any changes and not letting changes spur the mood is important. It is important to be a team member and put the goals of the team first.
